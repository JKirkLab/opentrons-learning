# opentrons-learning
Welcome to the Kirk Lab Opentrons learning repository! This is a repository to help summer students get up to speed with how to programatically use the Opentrons Flex liquid handler. 

# Overview

This repository contains tutorials to get setup with using the Kirk Lab Opentrons Flex Robot. The setup folder contains steps on how to install python, VS Code, the Opentrons app, git, and conda. The basics folder has small python scripts containing basic steps for working with Threepio/Rhonda. Finally, the examples folder contains a full protocol for sample aliquoting. 


# Requirements

- Some version of python 
- Opentrons app
- Some package manager (conda preferred)
- git
- Some code editor (VSCode, Spyder, Eclipse etc.)
- Connected to the same network as the robot (LUC)

# Steps

1. Start by reading the setup markdown files and setup all the steps necessary to begin working with the robot. 

2. Read through some basic examples of small functions provided by the opentrons API

3. Read through a fully developed protocol to get a better idea of what the final protocol should look like. 

4. Happy Coding!
